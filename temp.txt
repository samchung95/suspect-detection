I have a folder with subfolders (names by class id) that holds all images of the class
I would like to prepare a Dataset object for siamese network training
I want to use triple loss as the loss function and i want my dataset to include augmented images
I want to split into train, validation and test sets

folder structure:
root
>> dataset
   >> class (folder that hold all classes)
   >> siamese (output/destination folder where all labels and image file will be held)
>> script.py

Use this function structure, make sure to make directory if it doesnt exist
def prepareDataset(input_filepath='dataset/class', output_filepath = 'dataset/siamese'):
